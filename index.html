 Today I decided to run again. I used to run every day when the pandemic begun. <br>
 I thought seriously about both my physical and mental health, that going out for a run <br>
 in the riverbed sounded like a good idea. It helped me for months. Until I began working <br>
and was a full time university student. I haven't ran since January. So today, I stuggled <br>
to keep up the pace. But I know I will soon regain my condition.
